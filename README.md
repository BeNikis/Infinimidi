Markov chain midi generator experiment with a finite difference - discrete derivatives - twist.Assumes independence of the n-th difference and the lower ones at least until I get my head around implementing markov random fields or bayesian networks.

Sorry for the usability-will make it easier to use later.


Usage:
ruby infinimidi.rb <MIDIFile> #trackToLearn #orderOfFinDifferenceToLearn <play>
if <play> is not given,skip playing the chosen track
